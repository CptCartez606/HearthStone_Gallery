# HearthStone_Gallery
Website containing hearthstone cards.
Uses NodeJs with express, ejs, mongoose, and unirest.
Unirest grabs an api key from https://market.mashape.com/omgvamp/hearthstone and then stores it to mongodb.

BEFORE RUNNING: seed.js needs to be run first. Or just uncomment it out on app.js
